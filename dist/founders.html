For the last 17 years, his pursuit of how the mind and brain work led him to behavioral field studies in Africa and Central America and neurophysiology laboratory research from Harvard University to the National Institutes of Health, where for 5 years he held a double affiliation at the National Institute of Mental Health and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. His research has been distinguished with multiple awards, such as the Donald B. Lindsley Prize for Behavioral Neuroscience, featured in Nature Neuroscience and selected for the Society for Neuroscience 2012 Hot Topics List. Altogether, his research has contributed seminal findings on the evolutionary and neural foundations of human cognition and language, which are now incorporated in neurosciences reference textbooks and university curriculae. In the last 7 years, Dr. Gil-da-Costa’s work has focused on translational research, developing novel brain imaging methods and brain-machine interfaces at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. These last endeavors, together with Dr. Coleman, led to the development of several US patents and to founding Neuroverse, where he is now CEO. Dr. Gil-da-Costa is a reviewer for a wide variety of scientific journals and a science advisor for the Science and Entertainment Exchange, a program of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><p><strong>Ricardo Gil-da-Costa, Ph.D.</strong><br>Dr. Coleman received B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT and subsequently did a neuroscience postdoctoral stint at MIT and Massachusetts General Hospital. From 2006 to 2011, he was an Assistant Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois. He is currently an Associate Professor in the department of Bioengineering at UC San Diego and director of the Neural Interaction Laboratory. His research is highly inter-disciplinary and lies at the intersection of bio-electronics, neuroscience, medicine and applied mathematics. He is currently developing unobtrusive brain monitoring applications of his research on “epidermal electronics”, featured in Science in 2011. Dr. Coleman was an invited speaker at the 2013 American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting, on the topic of "Advances in Brain-Machine Interfaces: Applications and Implications".</p><hr><p>Both Drs. Gil-da-Costa and Coleman serve as science advisors for the National Academies Keck Futures Initiative, a program of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine. Their combined expertise, supported by an advisory board of leading neuroscientists, engineers and health and education professionals, enables a new level of advanced and impactful integrative solutions never before seen.</p><footer class=footer-primary>Copyright &copy; 2014 Neuroverse, Inc.
